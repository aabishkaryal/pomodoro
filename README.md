This is a pomodoro timer website for better time management.

### Live Demo: <https://pomodoro-six-lake.vercel.app/>

## Roadmap:

1. Notifications
1. Pop-up over whole screen
1. Addition of task list
1. Sync across devices with account

## Usage:

The way I prefer to use pomodoro is to break my task into tasks that can be completed in around 25 minutes (1 work session). Then take a break for 5 minute (1 break session). Repeat it to complete all tasks.

## Motivation:

On Manjaro, I had a plugin on taskbar/menubar for pomodoro which showed time on menubar and when the time ran out, a pop-up would appear. I had the option to extend the session or take a break. This was not available when I got a Mac and I couldn't find a good enough replacement. So, I decided to make it myself. üòÅ
